## About
Movie finder is a web-based application that enables users to look up information on a particular film.

## Context
This was a personal project that was built with React.JS and hosted on Heroku. To supply data for the searched movies, the program makes use of an API from tMDB, also known as The Movie Database. The program allows users to find a movie, watch a trailer, examine the movie poster, and find the actors/actresses of the film that they have chosen. Users will also be able to check the ratings and summary of the chosen film.
